## Areas Refactor and Counties Integration — Status Notes

Summary of the work completed in this session to bring county boundaries and stats into parity with ZIPs and to prepare the codebase for future area types (e.g., tracts).

### What’s Done

- Added Oklahoma county geometry and seeded synthetic COUNTY-level statData (with `parentArea: "Oklahoma"`). When real NE stats are detected, ZIP synthetic seeding is skipped, but COUNTY synthetic still seeds if missing.
- Choropleth overlays now switch by boundary mode:
  - ZIP mode paints `BOUNDARY_STATDATA_FILL_LAYER_ID` keyed by `feature.properties.zip`.
  - County mode paints `COUNTY_STATDATA_FILL_LAYER_ID` keyed by `feature.properties.county`.
  - Legend reads the active boundary type’s data and min/max.
- Selection/hover/pin parity for counties:
  - Mirrored ZIP interaction (click/shift-click/double-click-to-zoom, hover feedback, Esc clears transient).
  - County highlight/pinned lines/fills now use the same brand blue styling as ZIPs when no stat overlay is active; when a stat is active, both use subdued outline/fills for clarity over choropleth.
- Generalized map labels:
  - Reused the existing ZIP label controller with minimal hooks to render county labels (bbox centroids + county name). Visibility toggles on mode change.
- Persistence/UI state updated to store county selection + pins (in addition to existing ZIPs).
- Introduced shared `AreaKind` / `AreaId` primitives plus an area registry so map layers, bounds, and labels resolve via a single lookup. React now listens to map-driven area selection/hover events, keeping ZIP and county UI state in sync through one controller.
- Boundary toolbar now consumes the unified area state, so bulk actions (pin-all/unpin-all, chip removal) manipulate the shared controller and stay in sync with MapLibre interactions.

### What Still Differs Visually

- County base (non-selected) fill/line palette is intentionally lighter than ZIPs to avoid “map read noise” at statewide zoom. Selection/pin styling now matches ZIPs exactly; if elements still look off, it’s likely the underlying county basemap contrast. A single palette source is now used so fine-tuning takes effect for both.
### Gotchas and Notes
- MapLibre style reloads: `setStyle()` wipes custom layers/sources. We re-add all sources/layers on `styledata/idle` and then re-apply paints/filters. Keep any future area types registered in the same hook.
- Feature keys must match data keys:
  - ZIPs → `feature.properties.zip` (string)
  - Counties → `feature.properties.county` (5-char FIPS string, zero-padded)
  - Seeding uses those ids as the map keys; mismatches will result in “blank” choropleth cells.
- Label performance: DOM labels are cheap in quantity (selected+hovered), not for all features. We only render labels for selected/pinned/hovered areas.

### Suggested Next Steps

1. Area Abstraction (Phase 2)
   - Introduce `AreaKind = 'ZIP' | 'COUNTY' | 'TRACT'` and unified `AreaId = { kind, id }`.
   - Wrap selections/pins/hover into a single controller; replace ZIP/COUNTY branches in `mapView` and toolbar with a generic Area registry (feature key, bounds, name, label strategy, layer ids).

2. County Labels — Value Pills
   - For parity with ZIP stat pills, enable value display over county labels when a stat is selected.

3. Reports + Sidebar
   - Accept mixed area kinds and aggregate as needed. Short-term: keep ZIP-only in reports; medium-term: surface county comparisons.

4. Performance/UX Tweaks
   - Consider lazy-loading geometry for additional states; keep county layer fill even lighter at nationwide zoom.

### Quick Dev Hints

- If county choropleth is blank, verify `statDataStore` has `byStat.get(statId)?.COUNTY` populated and that county ids are 5-char FIPS.
- To tune selection colors globally, adjust the brand palette used in `updateBoundaryPaint` and the selection/highlight helpers in `layers/boundaries.ts`.
