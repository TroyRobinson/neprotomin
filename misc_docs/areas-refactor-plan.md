# Areas Refactor – Working Plan & Handoff Guide

 _Last updated: 2025‑10‑22_

---

## Background & Goals

- Build a single “areas” pipeline (ZIPs, counties, future tracts) so every UI surface can mix and match area types without bespoke branches.
- Keep MapLibre layers registry‑driven so pins/choropleths react the same way for each kind.
- Collapse React data plumbing onto shared hooks that synthesise stats/demographics, defaulting to sensible viewport baselines when the user hasn’t selected anything.

## Completed Phases

| Phase | Focus | Highlights |
| ----- | ----- | ---------- |
| Phase 0 | Registry groundwork (pre‑existing) | `AreaKind`/`AreaId`, map registry, toolbar + selection plumbing |
| Phase 1 | Schema + seed alignment | Added `areas` entity, populated centroids/bounds, updated seed scripts, normalised selection payloads |
| Phase 2 | Shared data plumbing | `useAreas`, `useStats`, `useDemographics` return per‑kind snapshots; sidebar/toolbar now consume unified selections |
| Phase 3 | Unified demographics & sidebar | Map emits camera defaults, `useDemographics` blends selection + viewport defaults, single sidebar card with “no data” messaging |

---

## Open Phases & Deliverables

1. **Map/report parity**
   - County choropleth legend + secondary stat overlay.
   - Report exports include counties, highlight missing metrics cleanly.
2. **Camera-driven QA & polish**
   - Manual smoke (selection, pinning, export, zoom states).
   - Copy/styling tweaks now that combined card is live.

## Latest Milestone – Unified Demographics Panel ✅

- Map now emits camera updates via `onCameraChange`, letting React infer the default demographic context (statewide vs. Tulsa vs. other counties).
- `useDemographics` accepts both selection + viewport defaults and returns a combined snapshot with missing‑data flags.
- Sidebar collapses to a single demographics card with blended stats, weighted breakdowns, and graceful fallback copy (“Data unavailable for this area”).

## Implementation Steps – Next Up

### A. Stats Integration Follow‑ups
1. ✔️ Update organisation sorting (stat weighting) to use the blended snapshot when counties are in play.
2. ✔️ Expose helper to get an area label (from `useAreas`) so stat/demographic UIs don’t repeat lookup logic.

### B. Prep for Phase 4 (map/report parity)
3. ✔️ Mirror secondary stat overlay for counties (currently ZIP-only); county centroid layer now resets its filter like the ZIP overlay.
4. ✔️ Report composer iterates `AreaId[]` and now aggregates/export county selections alongside ZIP rows.

### C. Current blockers & questions
- Need QA to ensure the new county filter reset survives style swaps (`styledata`/`idle` re-entry) and doesn’t flicker during hover transitions.
- Do we want a separate translate/offset for counties, or should we share the ZIP offset so mixed selections feel consistent? Needs design confirmation.
- Should the county centroid source be pruned to active counties only, or is the full statewide feature set required for future expansion?
- Validate county-weight weighting (population vs. simple average) and confirm numbers align with analytics expectations.
- Report currently prioritises ZIP selections when both ZIPs and counties are pinned; document whether mixed reports should show both or split into sections.
- Upcoming iteration: align report + sidebar with the Areas dropdown (single active kind), let timeline highlights include extra pinned areas beyond the active kind, and add an auto, “control by zoom” option so users can hand dropdown control back to auto-zoom mode.

## Gotchas & Watch‑outs

- **Missing data:** Counties outside Tulsa currently have no ZIP breakdowns. Aggregation helpers must guard against empty datasets and surface a consistent “No data yet” message rather than stale values.
- **Selection vs viewport defaults:** When the user clears selection, immediately fall back to the camera‑derived default. Avoid mixing stale selection data into the default snapshot.
- **Performance:** Blending large selections should avoid repeated JSON stringify—cache per‑kind aggregates where possible (e.g., memo keys on sorted area ids).
- **Tooling expectations:** `mapView` still emits legacy ZIP/County callbacks; ensure new hooks don’t inadvertently remove those until downstream consumers are updated.
- **Node version warning:** Vite expects ≥22.12.0 (current local is 22.11.0). Upgrade before CI or adjust tooling to avoid warnings.

## Handoff Checklist

- [x] Map exposes “default area” hint for demographics (zoom + camera derived).
- [x] `useDemographics` returns both `combinedSnapshot` and `byKind`, with missing-data flags.
- [x] Sidebar uses unified demographics card; stat viz/list already consuming shared snapshots.
- [x] Organisation sort weighting reuses blended stat data.
- [ ] Documentation (this file + existing retros) updated after each milestone.

Optional niceties once core work lands:

- Add storybook or local debug toggles for “simulate missing data”.
- Document the blending algorithm (population sum, weighted averages) in `docs/areas-status-notes.md`.

## Contact & Context

- Recent commits touch `src/react/hooks/useDemographics.ts`, `useStats.ts`, and sidebar components.
- Legacy docs: `docs/areas-refactor-retro.md`, `docs/areas-status-notes.md`.
- Seed scripts: `scripts/seed.ts` ensures `areas` table stays in sync locally.

If you pick up from here:
1. QA the county secondary stat overlay (hover/pin transitions, style swaps).
2. Sanity check report/sidebar behaviour when toggling Areas dropdown (ZIP ↔ county), including highlight extras and grey context chips.
3. Run `npm run build` and manually test zoom/selection edge cases.
